 Welcome to Module 1, Introduction to CI-CD. In this module, you'll get a broad introduction to continuous integration and continuous delivery, or CI-CD, as it's commonly referred to, which is an automated approach to developing and delivering software with repeatability and reliability. You'll discover what CI and CD are and the benefits they bring when implemented properly in your DevOps pipeline. You'll explore popular CI-CD tools and see why it's acceptable for different teams within an organization to use different CI-CD tools as long as they are eliminating manual procedures. You'll also learn about infrastructure as code, or IAC, which is the process by which you use code to automate the provisioning and the management of your infrastructure. IAC is a foundational concept for implementing automation. There are no labs in this first module, so the goal is to gain a high-level understanding of what CI-CD is before we dive deep into each topic individually. Let's get started.
